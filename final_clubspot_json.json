ASB trips take place during the first week of winter break and over the course of spring break. Groups of up to twelve students engage with community partners and social issues across the country to deep dive into the social issue and the work people are doing to address it.   ASB also offers class trips! Students participating in class trips take a peer-led, for-credit course taught by seasoned ASB veterans before heading out to work with the social issue they just spent the previous quarter learning about. These classes are a great way to deepen your learning about a social issue near to your heart, and also meet wonderful, passionate peers. For winter break class trips, the class takes place during the fall quarter. For spring break class trips, the classes take place during winter quarter. All these fantastic classes are also pass/fail!   You can get involved with ASB in several ways. Join our listserv to receive applications for upcoming trips by sending a request to asb@u.northwestern.edu.

It started out as an umbrella organization for all of the Asian/Asian American student groups to coordinate and guide their different activities. In 1992, the AAAB gained A-status from the Northwestern\u2019s Associated Student Government. The organization began to make headlines in 1995 when APAC organized a successful hunger strike fighting for the creation of an Asian American Studies Program. The incident garnered public support from universities all over the country and has served to inspire a new generation of young Asian Americans. In 2003, AAAB officially changed its name to The Asian Pacific American Coalition (APAC). The new name was intended to be more inclusive and reflective of the diverse and heterogeneous mix of Asian America. Along with the name change, APAC remade its constitution and redefined its mission statement towards a more holistic outlook, making commitments to community building by addressing political, cultural, and social issues of Asian America both within our own community and with the rest of NU\u2019s population through various programs and events. In the past, APAC has hosted events such as Asian American History Month, a screening of Better Luck Tomorrow with cast and director Justin Lin, the annual Mr. PanAsia, Powderpuff football, Espresso Expressions, and speakers such as actor George Takei, comedian Margaret Cho, music video director Joseph Kahn, SuChin Pak of MTV, Japanese Breakfast, and Alok Vaid-Menon.   APAC strives to achieve the following: Commit to accessibility and inclusion, especially with regard to non-East Asian communities Recognize differences in experience within the umbrella of Asian, Asian American, and Pacific Islander peoples, as well as the experiences of multiracial peoples Engage and mobilize the student community through activism and advocacy Undertake intersectional grassroots activism and advocacy in the larger Northwestern community, Evanston, and Chicago Foster collective healing from historical, intergenerational, and individual trauma Empower individuals with marginalized identities If you are interested in joining APAC, interest forms are open near the beginning of every quarter -- keep an eye out on the FB page or send us an email at apac@u.northwestern.edu for updates!",

New members are welcome to join at any point of the year, with no prior experience necessary to participate in either season. The dancesport dance classes are open to anyone and begin in the fall shortly after new student week. Auditions for the show occur early in Winter quarter and then subsequent rehearsals will occur throughout the year until showtime in Spring.  Classes, workshops, and social dance opportunities range in style from social dances like swing, salsa, or blues to more formal ballroom dances like waltz and tango. Our goal as an organization is to create a partner dancing community here at Northwestern. All dancers are welcome to attend our classes, workshops, and social events. If you want to get more involved, the best ways to become a formal member of BLAST is to regularly show up to dancesport classes and actively participate in either the competitive or performance seasons.",

We partner with local NGOs all over the world to work on projects, and plan events to fundraise and spread awareness.  We\u2019re motivated by 3 things. First, the world still under invests in girls. Even though a lot of progress has been made in terms of providing access to education for girls, still, there have been groups of girls that have been left behind in the broad rises to access to education. These girls are typically in the most difficult to reach places -- think indigenous, rural, communities, whose intersectionality in terms of broad societal marginalization has excluded them from big waves and progress towards universal access to education. This means that still, the most vulnerable girls are often the first ones to miss out on educations when families have to make hard decisions about who to send to school.  Each project is tailored to the specific school and community; we take into consideration their needs rather than imposing our own agenda. Projects look different in each place. Some have focused on access like building dorms in Kenya, expanding or increasing quality of education like building computer labs in Peru or A-level classrooms in Tanzania This is a video of the perfect example of what we try to power through our partnerships. This is a video of Bertha\u2019s story. Bertha is a graduate of Orkeeswa, a secondary school in rural Tanzania Circle of Women partnered with in 2015.",
